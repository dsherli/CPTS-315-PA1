Uses A-priori algorithm to look through a massive dataset and find frequent pairs and triples. 

## Imports

collections: used for the Counter() function so that keeping track of the appearance of items was simple and efficient. 

itertools: used to create different combinations of the frequent tuples. 

time: used to track the amount of time that the program took to execute

## Usage

To run the code, simply execute the "run_code.sh" file in your terminal. This will make all the imports, activate the venv, and run the script.
